# Steam Controller (2026) protocol stuff

Place to document the protocol of the new Steam Controller (apparently codenamed Triton). Information seems somewhat scattered currently. It would be nice to have most information in one place.

## How to run the stupid barely working audio player

- Figure out which hidraw device your controller is
- Convert audio file to 8 kHZ s16le PCM: `ffmpeg -i <your-audio-file> -f s16le -c:a pcm_s16le -ar 8000 -ac 2 output.pcm`
- Run the stupid thing: `RUST_LOG=trace cargo run --bin audio-test -- test-audio /dev/hidrawN output.pcm` (replace `hidrawN` with the correct device node)

Problems:

- huge pile of hacks
- only works when wired probably because pcm s16le is simply too much bandwidth
  - maybe try pcm s8 or ulaw instead?
- puck has `bInterval = 2` or 500 Hz USB polling rate. controller has `bInterval = 1` or 1000 Hz USB polling rate. puck quite literally does not have enough bandwidth to send stereo s16le. probably should send either mono s16le or s8/ulaw instead.

## Overview

Primary report is `0x45` which seems to contain most information. OpenPuck PROTOCOL.md has a good overview of this.

Note that Trackpad Lockout and Grip Sensors settings (among others) in the Steam "Calibration & Advanced Settings" menu affect what is reported. These settings are sent by Steam to the controller via HID Set Feature Report request, not via HID Set Output Report. Might be `SETTING_*` values in SDL's `controller_constants.h`.

Haptics seem to use several report ids in the range `0x81 - 0x89`.

`0x7B` is sent by the controller periodically only when using the puck.

## Interesting stuff

- Some simple tones (such as mode switch) are done by a sending haptic pulse command targeting a trackpad with the on/off duration and repeat count set to produce the desired frequency.

## Firmware

- Controller firmware image in `~/.local/share/Steam/bin/hardwareupdater`
- Triton (controller) firmware named `IBEX_FW_*.fw`
- Proteus (puck) firmware named `PROTEUS_FW_*.fw`
- Need to strip 32-byte header from these images and then the rest should be a Cortex-M binary

### Triton firmware

SoC is nRF52833.

- Base address seems to be `0x8000`, entrypoint ~~`0x0267ec`~~ (as in Cortex-M vector table)
- Entirely Thumb2
- rodata section starts somewhere around address `0x055000`
- Output report handler jump table starts at `0x05df7c`
- Feature report handler lookup table starts at `0x05de2c`
- Report `0x86` does a "stream op"?
- Report `0x87` takes a byte of either 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 0x80, and then a data buffer
- Report `0x88` takes a length byte, 31 bytes, and then 31 more bytes
- Report `0x89` seems identical to report `0x87` except for a byte inserted after the report ID which serves as the length of the data buffer. Not sure why this exists. Could just use `0x87` instead. Maybe things assume HID report is always fixed-length?

- `TP_LEFT` (side 0) is actuator 0
- `TP_RIGHT` (side 1) is actuator 1
- `INT_LEFT` (side 3) is actuator 2
- `INT_RIGHT` (side 4) is actuator 3

```
report 0x87 first byte:
0 -> left internal only
1 -> early return?
2 -> left and right internal
3 -> left trackpad only
4 -> right internal only
5 -> left and right trackpad
0x80 -> same as 2
```

the struct tentatively called `haptic_seq_queue_msg`:

- offset 0x0: operation, 0 = start, 1 = something else, 2 = stop
- offset 0x1: effect type
  - command zero(?): 9
  - command click: 0
  - command strong click: 1
  - stream op 1: 6
  - stream op 2: 2
  - pulse, on_us == 0: 9
  - pulse, on_us > 0 and off_us == 0: 0
  - pulse, on_us > 0 and off_us > 0 and repeat <= 4: 1
  - pulse, on_us > 0 and off_us > 0 and repeat > 4: 2
  - script, wilhelm scream: 7
  - rumble right: 4
  - rumble left: 3
  - log sweep: 5
  - LFO tone: 3
  - 9 should be stop all
- offset 0x2+: probably union

gain values seem clamped to the range -23 to 24

report 0x86:
- byte 0: operation: 1 = cancel effect 6, 2 = setup effect 6
- byte 1: side
- byte 2: for operation 2, effect 6 stream mode
  - param 0, 4, 8 can only be used with internal haptics (not touchpad) because 8 khz > 4 khz

effect 6 stream modes (`haptic_effect_6_data` offset 0x18):
- 0:  8 khz, 16 bit
- 1:  4 khz, 16 bit
- 2:  2 khz, 16 bit
- 3:  1 khz, 16 bit
- 4:  8 khz, 8 bit
- 5:  4 khz, 8 bit
- 6:  2 khz, 8 bit
- 7:  1 khz, 8 bit
- 8:  8 khz, 8 bit u-law
- 9:  4 khz, 8 bit u-law
- 10: 2 khz, 8 bit u-law
- 11: 1 khz, 8 bit u-law

report 0x44: seems to be some kind of haptics ack or flow control
- byte 0: which actuator
  - INT_LEFT: 0
  - INT_RIGHT: 1
  - TP_LEFT: 3
  - TP_RIGHT: 4
- byte 1: bitfield
  - 1: buffer overrun
  - 2: buffer underrun
  - 3: stream needs more data
  - 4: stream has enough data
  - 5: configuration rejected (invalid)
  - 6: configuration accepted
  - 7: configuration rejected (already running)
  - 8: unused?

### Firmware updater

- Extract `hardwareupdater.x86_64` with <https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor>
- Decompile `hardwareupdater.pyc` with <https://pylingual.io> or something else

## Misc notes

- SDL refers to the 2026 Steam Controller as Triton. Ibex may have been the codename for an older revision.
- HID descriptor for puck (on controller interfaces) and controller is identical.

## TODO

- wireshark PR, perhaps: <https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/merge_requests/25464>
- write wireshark dissector
  - note: currently dissector depends on `usbhid.product` field added in PR mentioned above
- figure out config set_report format
- figure out haptics output format
